### Description
Farmer John made a profit last year! He would like to invest it
well but wonders how much money he will make. He knows the interest
rate R (an integer between 0 and 20) that is compounded annually
at his bank.  He has an integer amount of money M in the range
100..1,000,000.  He knows how many years Y (range: 0..400) he intends
to invest the money in the bank. Help him learn how much money he
will have in the future by compounding the interest for each year
he saves.  Print an integer answer without rounding. Answers for the test
data are guaranteed to fit into a signed 32 bit integer.
