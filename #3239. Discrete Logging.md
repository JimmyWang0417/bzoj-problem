### Description
Given a prime P, 2 <= P < 231, an integer B, 2 <= B < P, and an integer N, 2 <= N < P, compute the discrete logarithm of N, base B, modulo P. That is, find an integer L such that 
    BL == N (mod P)

### Input
Read several lines of input, each containing P,B,N separated by a space,Â 
### Output
 for each line print the logarithm on a separate line. If there are several, print the smallest; if there is none, print "no solution". 
The solution to this problem requires a well known result in number theory that is probably expected of you for Putnam but not ACM competitions. It is Fermat's theorem that states 
   B(P-1) == 1 (mod P)

for any prime P and some other (fairly rare) numbers known as base-B pseudoprimes. A rarer subset of the base-B pseudoprimes, known as Carmichael numbers, are pseudoprimes for every base between 2 and P-1. A corollary to Fermat's theorem is that for any m 
   B(-m) == B(P-1-m) (mod P) .
