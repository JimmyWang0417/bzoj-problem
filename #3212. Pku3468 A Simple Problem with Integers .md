### Description
 
You have N integers, A1, A2, ... , AN. You need to deal with two kinds of operations. One type of operation is to add some given number to each number in a given interval. The other is to ask for the sum of numbers in a given interval. 



### Input

The first line contains two numbers N and Q. 1 ≤ N,Q ≤ 100000. 
The second line contains N numbers, the initial values of A1, A2, ... , AN. -1000000000 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000. 
Each of the next Q lines represents an operation. 
"C a b c" means adding c to each of Aa, Aa+1, ... , Ab. -10000 ≤ c ≤ 10000. 
"Q a b" means querying the sum of Aa, Aa+1, ... , Ab. 



### Output

You need to answer all Q commands in order. One answer in a line. 


 
### Sample Input
10 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Q 4 4
Q 1 10
Q 2 4
C 3 6 3
Q 2 4

### Sample Output
4
55
9
15

### Hint
The sums may exceed the range of 32-bit integers.
