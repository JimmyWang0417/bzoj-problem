### Description
Farmer John goes to Dollar Days at The Cow Store and discovers an unlimited number of tools on sale. During his first visit, the tools are selling variously for $1, $2, and $3. Farmer John has exactly $5 to spend. He can buy 5 tools at $1 each or 1 tool at $3 and an additional 1 tool at $2. Of course, there are other combinations for a total of 5 different ways FJ can spend all his money on tools. Here they are: 1 @ US$3 + 1 @ US$2 1 @ US$3 + 2 @ US$1 1 @ US$2 + 3 @ US$1 2 @ US$2 + 1 @ US$1 5 @ US$1 Write a program than will compute the number of ways FJ can spend N dollars (1 <= N <= 1000) at The Cow Store for tools on sale with a cost of $1..$K (1 <= K <= 100). 
    约翰到奶牛商场里买工具．商场里有K(1≤K≤100).种工具，价格分别为1，2，…，K美元．约翰手里有N(1≤N≤1000)美元，必须花完．那他有多少种购买的组合呢？
