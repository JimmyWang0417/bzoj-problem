### Description
Farmer John has returned to the County Fair so he can attend the special events (concerts, rodeos, cooking shows, etc.). He wants to attend as many of the N (1 <= N <= 10,000) special events as he possibly can. He's rented a bicycle so he can speed from one event to the next in absolutely no time at all (0 time units to go from one event to the next!). Given a list of the events that FJ might wish to attend, with their start times (1 <= T <= 100,000) and their durations (1 <= L <= 100,000), determine the maximum number of events that FJ can attend. FJ never leaves an event early.
