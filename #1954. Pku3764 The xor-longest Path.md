给定一棵n个点的带权树，求树上最长的异或和路径
### Input
The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n(1<=n<=100000), The following n-1 lines each contains three integers u(0 <= u < n),v(0 <= v < n),w(0 <= w < 2^31), which means there is an edge between node u and v of length w. 

### Output
For each test case output the xor-length of the xor-longest path.

### Sample Input
4
1 2 3
2 3 4
2 4 6

### Sample Output
7


### Hint
The xor-longest path is 1->2->3, which has length 7 (=3 ⊕ 4) 
注意：结点下标从1开始到N....
