### Description

You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) with n nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1 to n. 


Each node has a color, white or black, and a weight.
We will ask you to perfrom some instructions of the following form:


- 0 u : ask for the maximum weight among the nodes which are connected to u, two nodes are connected iff all the node on the path from u to v (inclusive u and v) have a same color. 
- 1 u : toggle the color of u(that is, from black to white, or from white to black). 
- 2 u w: change the weight of u to w. 





### Input

The first line contains a number n denoted how many nodes in the tree(1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next n - 1 lines, each line has two numbers (u,  v) describe a edge of the tree(1 ≤ u,  v ≤ n). 
The next 2 lines, each line contains n number, the first line is the initial color of each node(0 or 1), and the second line is the initial weight, let's say Wi, of each node(|Wi| ≤ 109).
The next line contains a number m denoted how many operations we are going to process(1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The next m lines, each line describe a operation (t,  u) as we mentioned above(0 ≤ t ≤ 2, 1 ≤ u ≤ n, |w| ≤ 109).




### Output

For each query operation, output the corresponding result.
