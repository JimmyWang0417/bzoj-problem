In this contest, Y*wan suck at this problem, if y*wan can't win, the mankind will become extinct, so it's your turn to help y*wan solve this problem.

There are n points in the plane, you pick a random point in [0,X] x [0,Y], after that you output the second nearest squared distance from this point to those n points. What is the expectation of your output?

### Input
The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains 3 integers n,X,Y.
The next n lines, each contains 2 integers x, y, denote that there is a point x,y.

T<=5,2<=n<=100.
0<=X,Y<=100 , -200<=x,y<=200

### Output

For each test case, output the answer in one line.
This problem is special judged. The relative error less than 1e-6 will be accepted.


### Sample Input
