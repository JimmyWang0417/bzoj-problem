### Description
Given an m*n grid, you're required to fill it with the numbers from 1 to m*n but the following rules should be satisfied:
1. each number in grid is larger than its above;
2. each number in grid is larger than its left.

Now, I wonder how many distinct solutions I could make on a grid.
For example. Consider such a 2*3 grid, we have the following solutions:
		123  124  134  135  125
		456  356  256  246  346

Thus, the sum is 5. 

### Input
Two positive integer m, n (0 < m, n < 10) per line. Two zeros indicate the end of input.

### Output
A single integer per line for each case -- the number of distinct solutions.

### Sample Input
2 3
0 0


### Sample Output

5

### Hint
本题为多组数据，请做到"0 0"结束
