### Description
The cows have been sent on a mission through space to acquire a new
milking machine for their barn.  They are flying through a cluster
of stars containing N (1 <= N <= 50,000) planets, each with a trading
post.

The cows have determined which of K (1 <= K <= 1,000) types of
objects (numbered 1..K) each planet in the cluster desires, and
which products they have to trade. No planet has developed currency,
so they work under the barter system: all trades consist of each
party trading exactly one object (presumably of different types).

The cows start from Earth with a canister of high quality hay (item
1), and they desire a new milking machine (item K). Help them find
the best way to make a series of trades at the planets in the cluster
to get item K.  If this task is impossible, output -1.


### Input
* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and K.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers, a_i
        and b_i respectively, that are planet i's trading trading
        products. The planet will give item b_i in order to receive
        item a_i.


### Output
* Line 1: One more than the minimum number of trades to get the
        milking machine which is item K (or -1 if the cows cannot
        obtain item K).

### Sample Input
6 5   //6个星球,希望得到5,开始时你手中有1号货物.
1 3   //1号星球,希望得到1号货物,将给你3号货物
3 2
2 3
3 1
2 5
5 4

### Sample Output
4


OUTPUT DETAILS:

The cows possess 4 objects in total: first they trade object 1 for
object 3, then object 3 for object 2, then object 2 for object 5.
