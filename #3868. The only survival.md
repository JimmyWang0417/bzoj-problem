The problem is about counting. How many undirected graphs satisfied the following constraints?

1. This graph is a complete graph of size n. 
2. Every edge has integer cost from 1 to L.
3. The cost of the shortest path from 1 to n is k.

Can you solve it?

output the answer modulo 10^9+7

### Input
The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains 3 integers n,k,L.

T<=5 n,k<=12,L<=10^9.

### Output

For each test case, output the answer in one line.
