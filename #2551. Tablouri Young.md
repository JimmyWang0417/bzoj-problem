### Description

Consider m natural numbers n1, n2, …, nm with the property n1³ n2³ …³ nm>0.
We define a Young table as an arrangement in a table of n1+n2+…+nm natural numbers (bigger than 0 and any two different), so that the ith line has ni elements (1£ i£ m) in ascending order from left to right, and the elements from the same column are in ascending order from bottom to top.
An example of Young table for m=4, n1=6, n2=4, n3=4, n4=1 is the following:






1


2


5


9


10


15




3


6


7


13






4


8


12


14






11












Task:

Given n1, n2, …, nm determine the number of Young tables containing the elements 1, 2, …, n1+n2+…+nm.

### Input

- on the first line is: the natural number m;


- on the second line are: the numbers n1, n2, …, nm separated by a space.

### Output

Constraints:



- 1<= m<= 20


- n1<=12
