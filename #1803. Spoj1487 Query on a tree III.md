### Description
You are given a node-labeled rooted tree with n nodes. 

Define the query (x, k): Find the node whose label is k-th largest in the subtree of the node x. Assume no two nodes have the same labels. 




### Input
The first line contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The next line contains n integers li (0 <= li <= 109) which denotes the label of the i-th node. 

Each line of the following n - 1 lines contains two integers u, v. They denote there is an edge between node u and node v. Node 1 is the root of the tree. 

The next line contains one integer m (1 <= m <= 10^4) which denotes the number of the queries. Each line of the next m contains two integers x, k. (k <= the total node number in the subtree of x) 




### Output

For each query (x, k), output the index of the node whose label is the k-th largest in the subtree of the node x.
