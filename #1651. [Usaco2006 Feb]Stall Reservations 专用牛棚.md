### Description
Oh those picky N (1 <= N <= 50,000) cows! They are so picky that each one will only be milked over some precise time interval A..B (1 <= A <= B <= 1,000,000), which includes both times A and B.  Obviously, FJ must create a reservation system to determine which stall each cow can be assigned for her milking time. Of course, no cow will share such a private moment with other cows.  Help FJ by determining: * The minimum number of stalls required in the barn so that each   cow can have her private milking period * An assignment of cows to these stalls over time  
有N头牛,每头牛有个喝水时间,这段时间它将专用一个Stall 现在给出每头牛的喝水时间段,问至少要多少个Stall才能满足它们的要求
### Input
* Line 1: A single integer, N 
 * Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes cow i's milking interval with two         space-separated integers.
### Output
* Line 1: The minimum number of stalls the barn must have.
  * Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes the stall to which cow i will be         assigned for her milking period.

Here's a graphical schedule for this output:

Time     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
Stall 1 c1>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Stall 2 .. c2>>>>>> c4>>>>>>>>> .. ..
Stall 3 .. .. c3>>>>>>>>> .. .. .. ..
Stall 4 .. .. .. c5>>>>>>>>> .. .. ..

Other outputs using the same number of stalls are possible.
### Hint
不妨试下这个数据,对于按结束点SORT,再GREEDY的做法 1 3 5 7 6 9 10 11 8 12 4 13 正确的输出应该是3
