### Description
As we know, Rikka is poor at math. At the test, Rikka finds that she cannot even do a single problem. There is one of the insane problems:

Given an integer K, she needs to come up with an n×n 01 matrix A and an integer m which meet B1,n=K, where B=Am.

It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?
输入k，输出一个n*n的有向图，使从1走m条边到n的路径数正好为k

### Input
The first line of the input is a single integer T (T=40), indicating the number of testcases. 

Each of the next T lines contains one integer K (0≤K≤10^18). 
### Output
For each testcase, the first line contains two space-separated integers n,m (1≤n,m≤30).

In each of following n lines print n characters (0 or 1) - the matrix A you find.
### Sample Input
1
4
### Sample Output
2 4
11
01
