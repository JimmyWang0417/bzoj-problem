### Description
Farmer John has just arranged his NN haybales (1≤N≤100,0001≤N≤100,000) at various points along t
he one-dimensional road running across his farm. To make sure they are spaced out appropriately, ple
ase help him answer QQ queries (1≤Q≤100,0001≤Q≤100,000), each asking for the number of haybales 
within a specific interval along the road.

给出N（1≤N≤100,000）个数，和   Q（1≤Q≤100,000）个询问。每个询问包含两个整数A,B(0≤A≤B≤1,000,00
0,000）。对于每个询问，给出数值在A到B间的数有多少个（包含A与B）。



### Input
The first line contains N and Q.The next line contains N distinct integers, each in the range 0…1,0
00,000,000 indicating that there is a haybale at each of those locations.Each of the next Q lines co
ntains two integers AA and BB (0≤A≤B≤1,000,000,000) giving a query for the number of haybales bet
ween A and B, inclusive.


### Output
write Q lines of output. For each query, output the number of haybales in its respective interval.
