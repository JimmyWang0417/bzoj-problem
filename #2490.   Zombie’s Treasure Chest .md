### Description
Some brave warriors come to a lost village. They are very lucky and find a lot 
of treasures and a big treasure chest, but with angry zombies. 
The warriors are so brave that they decide to defeat the zombies and then 
bring all the treasures back. A brutal long-drawn-out battle lasts from morning to 
night and the warriors find the zombies are undead and invincible. 
Of course, the treasures should not be left here. Unfortunately, the warriors 
cannot carry all the treasures by  the treasure chest due to the  limitation of  the 
capacity of the chest. Indeed, there are only two types of treasures: emerald and 
sapphire.  All  of  the emeralds  are equal in size and value, and with infinite 
quantities. So are sapphires. 
Being the priest of the warriors with the magic artifact: computer, and given 
the size of the chest, the value and size of each types of gem, you should compute 
the maximum value of treasures our warriors could bring back. 
### Input
  There are multiple test cases. The number of test cases T (T <= 200) is given 
in the first line of the input file.  For  each test case,  there  is  only one line 
containing five integers N, S1, V1, S2, V2, denoting the size of the treasure chest is 
N and the size and value of an emerald is S1 and V1, size and value of a sapphire 
is S2, V2. All integers are positive and fit in 32-bit signed integers.
