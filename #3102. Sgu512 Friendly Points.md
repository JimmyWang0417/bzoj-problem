### Description

Consider n distinct points on a plane.

Two points from that set are said to be friends, when there exists a rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes that contains those two points and doesn't contain any other point from the given set. A rectangle is said to contain a point if the point lies within the rectangle or on its border.

How many pairs of friends are there among the given points?
求这样的点对个数：以两点连线为对角线的矩形内不存在其他点（也不能在边界上）
### Input
The first line of the input file contains an integer n,1<=N<=100 000.
